My past work at harm reduction centers and as a qualitative interviewer has illuminated the patchwork of U.S. health care and social support policies that I hope to address through my work.\nOverarchingly, I am passionate about investigating: what is the blueprint of a successful, comprehensive model of services for people who use drugs? I hope my work can demonstrate how to leverage policy to equitably expand access to substance use disorder treatment and serve the needs of policymakers, practitioners, and advocates in the substance use and mental health fields. In my future work, I would love to collaborate with and amplify voices of people with lived experience."

On the other hand, there is a drastic difference in abstinence from heroin between methamphatamine use groups, where individuals reporting any lifetime methamphetamine use had almsot two times greater percent non-abstinence. Although looking at the distribution of heroin use frequency over the last 90 days, it appears that there are similar distributions by methamphetamine use groups. This webstie includes a preliminary analysis to show the underlying differences between people with opioid use disorder by methamphatamine use status. The descriptive nature of this analysis calls for a more rigorous causal methods controlling for self-selection and biases between groups to understand the effect of methamphetamine use on treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ndplyr: filter, mutate, group_by, summarize, count ggplot2: geom_boxplot, geom_bar, geom_histogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
