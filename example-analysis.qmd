1. You must describe what is the question you aim to answer with the data and data analysis.

**In this analysis, I utilized data from the CDC's Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) Study to understand the association of co-use of opioids and methamphetamine with treatment outcomes and overdose.[@cdc_medications_2024]** 

2. You must describe who is the intended audience for the data analysis.

**The intended audience for this analysis is researchers trying to understand the nuances of polysubstance use on treatment outcomes, specifically among individuals seeking medications for opioid use disorder.** 

3. You must describe and link to where the original data come from that you chose.

**The MOUD Study was a longitudinal, observational cohort study conducted from 2017 to 2021. The study sample recruited 1974 individuals with with opioid use disorder (OUD) from 62 outpatient facilities in 11 states over 18 months.**

4. You must include a link to a data dictionary for the data or create one inside the webpage.

**The [MOUD Study data](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/media/files/2024/04/Patient-18-month-Data.csv) as well as the [codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/media/pdfs/2024/04/The-MOUD-Study-Codebook.pdf) is publicly available on the CDC's website.[@cdc_medications_2024]**

5. Your analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from dplyr or tidyr.

**The data wrangling was done using the following functions: filter, mutate, group_by, summarize, count.**

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

moud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Patient-18-month-Data.csv"))
moud_clean <- moud %>%
  filter(responded == 1 & MAT_COUN != 4) %>% # remove no response records, only counseling tx
  mutate(daysinxtx = as.numeric(daysinxtx),
         socialsupportscore = as.numeric(socialsupportscore))

retention_summary <- moud_clean %>% # retention by meth use and type of MOUD 
  group_by(SU10_10, MAT_COUN) %>%
  summarize(mean(daysinxtx)) %>% 
  rename(
    MOUD = MAT_COUN,
    Meth_Use = SU10_10)

boxplot <- moud_clean %>% # boxplot comparing days in tx by lifetime meth use
  ggplot(aes(x = interaction(SU10_10, MAT_COUN), y = log(daysinxtx))) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Days in Treatment by Methamphetamine Use and Type of MOUD",
       x = "MOUD Type and Methamphetamine Use Status",
       y = "Log(Days in Treatment)") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot)

abstinence_summary <- moud_clean %>% # percent 30 day abstinence by meth use
  group_by(SU10_10) %>%
  filter(abstinent30ohf != "U") %>%
  count(abstinent30ohf) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)
  
bargraph <- abstinence_summary %>% # bargraph comparing percent abstinence by lifetime meth use
  filter(abstinent30ohf == 0) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = SU10_10, y = percent)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Abstinence by Methamphetamine Use",
       x = "Methamphetamine Use",
       y = "Percent Abstinent (30 days) from Opioids") +
  theme_minimal()
print(bargraph)

histogram <- moud_clean %>% # histogram of the distribution of support scores by lifetime meth use
  ggplot(aes(x = socialsupportscore)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +  
  facet_wrap(~SU10_10, scales = "free") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Social Support Score by Methamphetamine Use",
       x = "Social Support Score",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
print(histogram)
```

6. Your analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom() functions).

**The analysis includes a boxplot, bar graph, and a histogram.**

7. Plots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels.

**Make labels of x-axis in boxplot and bargraph readable**

8. At least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).

**The histogram was made using facet_wrap to display differing distributions of social support scores between those who did and did not report methamphetamine use.**

9. Your analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).

![Characteristics of the recruiting treatment facilities](images/table.png) [@dever_medications_2024]

10. Your analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.

::: {.callout-note}
In this analysis, we used lifetime use of methamphetamine, which is not an accurate measure of concurrent methamphetamine and opioid use. This descriptive analysis cannot provide insight into ongoing methamphatamine use while engaged in MOUD.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
The MOUD study data was collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This descriptive analysis only utilized 18-month follow-up data which had a 53.4% response rate. The high rate of attrition may may be due to systemic drop-out and thus generalizability of results is limited.
:::

11. Your analysis must include a .bib file, which you use to reference at least three unique citations. For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data.

**I cited the CDC data webpage, the study with the characteristics of the recruitment sites (table above), and a sentence in the analysis.**

12. Your analysis must include the use of at least 1 margin content.
```{r}
#| column: margin

knitr::kable(
  retention_summary[1:6, 1:3]
)
```

13. You must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).

**Opioids and methamphetamine co-use has dramatically increased in the past decade, and there is a need to understand the imapct on traditional opioid use disorder treatment outcomes.[@han_methamphetamine_2021]**

14. At the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above.

**dplyr: filter, mutate, group_by, summarize, count**
**ggplot2: geom_boxplot, geom_bar, geom_histogram**
