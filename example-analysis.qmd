# Research Question:
 What is the association between methamphetamine use and treatment outcomes among people receiving medications for opioid use disorder? In this analysis, I utilized data from the CDC's Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) Study.[@cdc_medications_2024]

# Intended Audience:
The intended audience for this analysis is practitioners and researchers trying to understand differences in medications for opioid use disroder treatment outcomes between people who do and do not use methamphetamine.

# Data Source:
The MOUD Study was a longitudinal, observational cohort study conducted from 2017 to 2021. The study sample recruited 1974 individuals with with opioid use disorder (OUD) from 62 outpatient facilities in 11 states over 18 months. The [MOUD Study data](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/media/files/2024/04/Patient-18-month-Data.csv) as well as the [codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/media/pdfs/2024/04/The-MOUD-Study-Codebook.pdf) is publicly available on the CDC's website.[@cdc_medications_2024] 

::: {.callout-warning}
The MOUD study data was collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This descriptive analysis only utilized 18-month follow-up data which had a 53.4% response rate. The high rate of attrition may may be due to systemic drop-out and thus generalizability of results is limited.

moud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Patient-18-month-Data.csv"))

  mutate(daysinxtx = as.numeric(daysinxtx),
         HU6 = as.numeric(HU6))
```

::: {.callout-note}
In this analysis, we used lifetime use of methamphetamine, which is not an accurate measure of concurrent methamphetamine and opioid use. This descriptive analysis cannot provide insight into ongoing methamphatamine use while engaged in MOUD.

# Summary
Opioids and methamphetamine co-use has dramatically increased in the past decade, and there is a need to understand the imapct on traditional opioid use disorder treatment outcomes.[@han_methamphetamine_2021] The boxplot comparing days in treatment by lifetime methamphetamine use and type of medication indicates some minor, non-significant differences in retention. On the other hand, there is a drastic difference in abstinence from heroin between methamphatamine use groups, where individuals reporting any lifetime methamphetamine use had almsot two times greater percent non-abstinence. Although looking at the distribution of heroin use frequency over the last 90 days, it appears that there are similar distributions by methamphetamine use groups. This webstie includes a preliminary analysis to show the underlying differences between people with opioid use disorder by methamphatamine use status. The descriptive nature of this analysis calls for a more rigorous causal methods controlling for self-selection and biases between groups to understand the effect of methamphetamine use on treatment.
