	abstract = {Objective:Opioid use disorder (OUD) affects approximately 5.6 million people in the United States annually, yet rates of the use of effective medication for OUD (MOUD) treatment are low. We conducted an observational cohort study from August 2017 through May 2021, the MOUD Study, to better understand treatment engagement and factors that may influence treatment experiences and outcomes. In this article, we describe the study design, data collected, and treatment outcomes.Methods:We recruited adult patients receiving OUD treatment at US outpatient facilities for the MOUD Study. We collected patient-level data at 5 time points (baseline to 18 months) via self-administered questionnaires and health record data. We collected facility-level data via questionnaires administered to facility directors at 2 time points. Across 16 states, 62 OUD treatment facilities participated, and 1974 patients enrolled in the study. We summarized descriptive data on the characteristics of patients and OUD treatment facilities and selected treatment outcomes.Results:Approximately half of the 62 facilities were private, nonprofit organizations; 62\% focused primarily on substance use treatment; and 20\% also offered mental health services. Most participants were receiving methadone (61\%) or buprenorphine (32\%) and were predominately non-Hispanic White (68\%), aged 25-44 years (62\%), and female (54\%). Compared with patient-reported estimates at baseline, 18-month estimates suggested that rates of abstinence increased (55\% to 77\%), and rates of opioid-related overdoses (7\% to 2\%), emergency department visits (9\% to 4\%), and arrests (15\% to 7\%) decreased.Conclusions:Our results demonstrated the benefits of treatment retention not only on abstinence from opioid use but also on other quality-of-life metrics, with data collected during an extended period. The MOUD Study produced rich, multilevel data that can lay the foundation for an evidence base to inform OUD treatment and support improvement of care and patient outcomes.},
